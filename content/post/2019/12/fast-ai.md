I came across a great episode while listening to [Software Engineering Radio](https://www.se-radio.net)
the other day while on my morning walk.

[Episode 391](https://www.se-radio.net/2019/12/episode-391-jeremy-howard-on-deep-learning-and-fast-ai/) features
Jeremy Howard from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) explaining deep learning from concept to implementation.

I had heard of fast.ai before in an [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) meetup where I met a gentlemen
who designs machine learning systems for monitoring people in hospital beds. The system uses visual
detection aided by deep learning to alert staff if a patient has fallen from their bed hopefully
getting the patient the help they need more quickly. In our discussion he brought up fast.ai as a
great learning resource.

The course is available at <https://course.fast.ai/> and includes videos, jupyter notebooks, and
instructions on how to use cloud resources to get up and running.

Here is a preview of lesson one if you want to get a quick peek:
